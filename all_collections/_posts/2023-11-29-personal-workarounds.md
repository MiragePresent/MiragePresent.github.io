Understanding yourself is a no-brainer; it's like having your own set of superpowers. Some people shine when it comes to paying attention to details, others can make quick decisions, while some are good at handling tricky situations or being creative with non-trivial ideas or solutions. It can make you lose confidence when you start comparing yourself with others but it's perfectly fine to have aspects that are still getting stronger â€” moments that stress you out or areas where you're figuring things out.

It's not about being perfect; it's about understanding how to make things work for you.

my weaknesses

I often have a hard time paying attention. You know, a type of person who can read "except" as "accept" and then re-read the sentence again and again, trying to understand the meaning. Or losing words in texts and messages is like my other "superpower". Maybe there is no such type of people but it definitely describes me.

Oh, almost forgot, yes, I forget things a lot. It's something like going to the store to buy apples and coming back with everything else except the apples.
